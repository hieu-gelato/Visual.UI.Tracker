# Visual.UI.Tracker
-Designed and implemented a real-time automation system using Python, OpenCV, PyTesseract, and PyAutoGUI to detect live on-screen events via OCR and dynamically target corresponding UI elements across multiple application regions.
-Built a custom calibration and coordinate-mapping workflow to support ultra-wide and multi-monitor environments, ensuring accurate region capture and reliable interaction despite DPI scaling and layout changes.
-Optimized performance by minimizing OCR regions, reducing polling latency, and eliminating unnecessary I/O, 80–90 percent faster than average human response time (250–500ms)
-Developed an event-driven control mechanism that enabled precise sequencing: automated targeting → user confirmation → conditional redirection → system pause, improving correctness and preventing unintended actions.
