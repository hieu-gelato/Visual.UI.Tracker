## 🖥️ Visual.UI.Tracker

---

**Designed and implemented a real-time automation system** using **Python, OpenCV, PyTesseract, and PyAutoGUI** to detect live on-screen events via OCR and dynamically target corresponding UI elements across multiple application regions.

---

**Built a custom calibration and coordinate-mapping workflow** to support ultra-wide and multi-monitor environments, ensuring accurate region capture and reliable interaction despite DPI scaling and layout changes.

---

**Optimized performance** by minimizing OCR regions, reducing polling latency, and eliminating unnecessary I/O, achieving **80–90 percent faster response** than average human reaction time (**250–500ms**).

---

**Developed an event-driven control mechanism** that enable
