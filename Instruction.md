## 🗂️ Two-Tab Setup (Left + Right)

### ⬅️ Left Tab — Intended Website (Inputs)
- Keep your **target website** open here.
- This is the page where you’ll **type / select inputs** and eventually **submit**.

### ➡️ Right Tab — Live Notifications
- Keep your **live notifications** open here.
- This is what the system watches via **OCR** to detect events and react accordingly.

✅ Tip: Place both tabs side-by-side for consistent coordinates.

## 🎯 Step 1 — Calibrate OCR Regions (Regions to Read)

### 📌 What this does
Defines the screen areas where OCR should look for text/events.

### 🧪 Run calibration
